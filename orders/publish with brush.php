                                Thank you for your interest in publishing with Brush Education. We serve college, university, and professional audiences in several subject areas including medical and health sciences, education, and K9 training. We maintain high standards for editing and book design. Our books are produced within an e-publishing workflow, which provides both digital and print editions. We work very closely with our authors to ensure the best results, both editorially and when mapping formats for students, trainers, and practitioners. Our ultimate goal is to produce high-value resources that provide studying efficiencies and better student learning outcomes.

                                We welcome your manuscript proposals. Please contact Lauri Seidlitz, managing editor, at lauri.seidlitz@brusheducation.ca (please do not call to discuss your submission). Your proposal should include an overview of your manuscript, your views on where your book would sell, information about yourself, and, if you have previously published, a list of your books and/or articles. Please allow 4â€“6 weeks for a response. We will respond to all submissions but we will not provide editorial feedback on manuscripts that are not well-suited to our list.

                                Brush Education is doing something no other independent Canadian publisher is doing: publishing health-science and medical books for Canadians. Our books are not modified or adapted texts from other countries. Our principal authors live, work, and teach in Canada, and their books are written and edited for Canadian students and practitioners. We are able to adapt some of our medical and health science resources for other markets, such as the United States.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We are interested in receiving medical and health-science manuscripts or ideas for publication. We are particularly interested in works that provide direct instructional or practical support for students, residents, or practitioners in medicine, nursing, and related professions. Ideal projects for Brush fill a gap in available resources. If your area of instruction or practice lacks an important professional or learning resource, we would like to work with you to build it. We are also happy to consider creative partnerships with institutions or organizations to create original Canadian resources where they are needed.
